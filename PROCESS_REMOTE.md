_intended audience: interviewer_

# How to conduct a remote interview

## Prior to the interview

The candidate will have been sent a link to [the candidate information](/CANDIDATE_INFORMATION.md), highlighting the remote interview process.

## Preparation for the interviewer
The candidate should have cloned the [skeleton project repository](https://github.com/guardian/pairing-test-project) on their machine.

Ask the candidate to share their screen and ensure the following are working properly:
- audio
- video
- IDE font-size

Get some pen and paper in case the candidate (or you) need to draw anything.

Explain what you’re going to be doing today.
This is the coding exercise stage of the interview process. We’ll spend about 60 minutes writing code to solve a problem and upto 30 mins for everyone to ask questions. We’re not assessing you on your deep technical knowledge or your understanding of the standard library, we’re more interested in how you solve a problem. With that in mind, feel free to search online for anything, ask questions etc. It’s not about how far we get through the exercise. You will be required to submit your submission as a Gist or zip. You will also have the opportunity to ask the interviewer questions about the interview process, the role, the company, etc.

## Tips for the interviewer during the interview
Provide guidance on where to start. For example, directory structure, where to add tests etc.

Try not to dictate a solution as this doesn’t provide much detail about the candidate.

If the candidate is struggling, guide them to a solution. This can take many forms, such as diagramming, pseudo code etc.

If you see a really obvious mistake, don’t let the candidate struggle with it. For example, if they’ve misspelt a variable, passed arguments to a function in the wrong order etc.

Ask why the candidate is doing things that way to help understand their thought process.

## After the interview
Fill in the assesment promptly. 


**Do not let candidates push their solution to remote.**

Raise an issue or PR for any improvements to the exercises.
