# Pairing Exercises

Thank you for your interest in the Trint's coding exercises. This repository is forked and adapted from The Guardian's exercises. These exercises are used for all engineering roles, at all levels.

## What is it?
The pairing exercise is one of the stages in our interview process. It is a 60-90 minute exercise where you and two Trint engineers work together writing code to solve a problem.

Similar to when you pair with a colleague, there will be a driver and a navigator. The driver will be the one at the keyboard, whilst the navigator will be making suggestions and asking questions.

You will typically play the role of driver and the Trint engineers will be the navigator.

## Why do we perform it?
A pairing exercise is an oppotunity for both you (the candidate) and members from Trint to get to know eachother whilst working through and solving problem together. Techincial exercises are stressful, so we try to create an environment were it's about the journey.  What do you prioritise? How you communicate your thinking? How you respond to any suggestions or advice? This is so much more valuable than seeing if you can flexing your deep knowledge of a specific language's compilation process. We're perfectly happy if, like every other day, we need to search online to remember how something works, this isn't a test to see if you can remember everything.

Our hope is the 60-90 minutes will be pleasant and enough time to work out if we are right for you, or if you're the person we need at this time.

## What language?
We are a prodominately a TypeScript/JavaScript environment but to help reduce the stress of the situation you can still elect to use any other language (e.g. PHP/Go/Ruby), providing we can find somebody to pair with you.

## Which exercise?

We use the exercises in this repository and they are used for every Engineering role. 

We also have [this repository](https://github.com/trint-it/coding-exercise-project) on GitHub with skeleton projects that can be used.
